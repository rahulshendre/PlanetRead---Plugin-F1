## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Adobe Premiere Pro** (recent version with CEP support)
- **Creative Cloud** subscription
- **Text Editor** (Sublime Text, VS Code, or similar)
- **Web Browser** (for testing HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

### Knowledge Requirements
- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Understanding of Adobe ExtendScript (JavaScript-based)
- Familiarity with XML structure
- Basic understanding of file systems and paths

## Development Environment Setup

For detailed installation guide, please follow: **[Installation Guide](https://github.com/PlanetRead/subtitle-tool-for-Adobe-Premier/blob/rahul_featureOne/INSTALLATION.md)**

### Step 1: Enable Unsigned Extensions

Before any extension can load in Premiere Pro, you must enable the loading of unsigned panels.

#### For Windows:
1. Open **Registry Editor** (`regedit`)
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\CSXS.X` (where X is your CEP version)
3. Create a new **String Value** named `PlayerDebugMode`
4. Set the value to `1`

#### For Mac:
1. Open **Terminal**
2. Run the following command (replace `username` with your actual username and X with your CEP version):
```bash
defaults write /Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.X.plist PlayerDebugMode 1
```

#### CEP Version Notes:
- Check your Premiere Pro version to determine the correct CSXS version number
- Common versions: CSXS.6, CSXS.7, CSXS.8, etc.
- This enables unsigned extension loading for development

### Step 2: Extension Directory Setup

Extensions are placed in specific directories depending on your operating system:

#### Windows:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\
```

#### Mac:
```
/System/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/
```

**Important:** Use the **System Library**, not the User Library.

## Extension File Structure

A basic Premiere Pro extension requires the following file structure:

```
YourExtensionName/
├── CSXS/
│   └── manifest.xml
├── index.html
├── jsx/
│   └── extendScript.jsx
└── lib/
    └── CSInterface.js
```

### Optional Additional Files:
- `css/` folder for stylesheets
- Additional JavaScript libraries in `lib/`
- `assets/` folder for images and resources

## Core Files Explained

### 1. manifest.xml

The manifest file is the most critical component. It tells Premiere Pro how to load and display your extension.

#### Template Source

You can get a complete template with all the necessary files from the official Adobe CEP Samples repository:
**[https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel)**

This template includes:
- Complete manifest.xml configuration
- Sample HTML interface
- ExtendScript examples
- All required libraries and dependencies

#### Important Configuration Points:

- **ExtensionBundleId**: Must be unique across all extensions
- **Host Version**: Must match your Premiere Pro version
- **CSXS Version**: Must match your CEP version (check your Premiere Pro version)
- **MainPath**: Points to your HTML file
- **ScriptPath**: Points to your ExtendScript file
- **Menu**: The name that appears in Premiere's Extensions menu

### 2. index.html

This file creates the user interface for your extension. It's essentially a web page that runs inside Premiere Pro.

#### Key Components:

- **CSInterface.js**: Adobe's JavaScript library for communication with ExtendScript
- **Button Events**: Handle user interactions
- **CSInterface.evalScript()**: Execute ExtendScript functions from HTML

For complete examples and templates, refer to the [Adobe CEP Samples repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel).

### 3. extendScript.jsx

This file contains the actual functionality that interacts with Premiere Pro. It's written in ExtendScript, which is Adobe's JavaScript implementation.

#### Key ExtendScript Concepts:

- **app.project.activeSequence**: Access the current timeline
- **app.setSDKEventMessage()**: Send messages to Premiere's Events panel
- **File operations**: Read/write files using ExtendScript File objects
- **Timeline manipulation**: Add clips, modify properties, etc.

For complete examples and templates, refer to the [Adobe CEP Samples repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel).

### 4. CSInterface.js

This is Adobe's provided JavaScript library that enables communication between your HTML interface and ExtendScript. It's essential for any CEP extension.

#### Key Methods:

- **CSInterface.evalScript()**: Execute ExtendScript code
- **CSInterface.getSystemPath()**: Get system paths
- **CSInterface.getApplicationVersion()**: Get Premiere version

This file is included in the [Adobe CEP Samples repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel).

## Standalone ExtendScript Development with ExtendScript Debugger

### Overview

For rapid prototyping and testing of ExtendScript code without creating a full extension, you can use the **ExtendScript Debugger** extension. This allows you to write and run standalone .jsx scripts directly in Premiere Pro using alert boxes and prompts for user interaction.

### Installing ExtendScript Debugger

1. Download the ExtendScript Debugger extension from Adobe Exchange or the official Adobe CEP Samples
2. Install it in your extensions directory following the same process as other extensions
3. Restart Premiere Pro
4. Access it via **Window > Extensions > ExtendScript Debugger**

### Writing Standalone .jsx Scripts

#### Basic Structure

Create a .jsx file with your ExtendScript code:

```javascript
// Your script logic here
var seq = app.project.activeSequence;
if (!seq) {
    alert("No active sequence found!");
} else {
    alert("Active sequence: " + seq.name);
}
```

#### User Interaction Methods

The ExtendScript Debugger runs scripts in a context where you can use:

- **alert()**: Display information to the user
- **prompt()**: Get input from the user
- **confirm()**: Get yes/no confirmation from the user

#### Example Workflow

1. **Write your script** in a text editor and save as .jsx file
2. **Load the script** in ExtendScript Debugger
3. **Run the script** - it will execute and show alerts/prompts
4. **Debug interactively** - modify and re-run as needed
5. **Test thoroughly** before integrating into a full extension

#### Advantages of Standalone Development

- **Rapid prototyping**: Test ExtendScript logic quickly
- **Interactive debugging**: Use alerts and prompts for user feedback
- **No HTML interface needed**: Focus purely on Premiere Pro automation
- **Easy testing**: Run scripts multiple times without restarting Premiere
- **Learning tool**: Understand ExtendScript capabilities before building extensions

#### Limitations

- **Alert-based UI only**: Limited to basic alert/prompt/confirm dialogs
- **No persistent interface**: Each script run is independent
- **Basic user interaction**: No complex forms or controls
- **Debugging only**: Not suitable for production user interfaces

### Integration with Full Extensions

Once you've tested your ExtendScript logic using the ExtendScript Debugger:

1. **Copy the working code** from your .jsx file
2. **Paste it into your extension's** extendScript.jsx file
3. **Wrap it in functions** that can be called from your HTML interface
4. **Replace alerts/prompts** with proper UI elements and CSInterface communication
5. **Add error handling** and user feedback through the Events panel

This workflow allows you to develop and test the core Premiere Pro automation logic quickly before building the full extension interface.

## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Create Extension Structure

1. Create a new folder in your extensions directory
2. Set up the basic file structure:
   ```
   YourExtension/
   ├── CSXS/
   │   └── manifest.xml
   ├── index.html
   ├── jsx/
   │   └── extendScript.jsx
   └── lib/
       └── CSInterface.js
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Manifest

1. Copy the manifest template
2. Update all placeholder values:
   - ExtensionBundleId
   - ExtensionBundleName
   - Menu name
   - File paths

### Step 3: Create HTML Interface

1. Design your user interface
2. Add form elements, buttons, and controls
3. Implement JavaScript event handlers
4. Style with CSS

### Step 4: Implement ExtendScript Logic

1. Write your Premiere Pro automation code
2. Handle file operations
3. Implement error handling
4. Add user feedback

### Step 5: Test and Debug

1. Restart Premiere Pro
2. Load your extension from Window > Extensions
3. Test all functionality
4. Check Premiere's Events panel for messages
5. Use browser developer tools for HTML debugging

## Testing and Debugging

### Debugging HTML/CSS/JavaScript

1. **Browser Developer Tools**: Right-click in your extension panel and select "Inspect Element"
2. **Console Logging**: Use `console.log()` for debugging
3. **Network Tab**: Check for failed resource loads
